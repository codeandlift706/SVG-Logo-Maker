When I open up the command line and run node index.js
I answer a series of questions on what my logo design is like
my series of questions = [
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up <= three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number #22ff00)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
]



the command line captures my user input and based on my user input: 
generates a custom design
console.log("Generated logo.svg")
createFile named 'logo.svg', with the contents based on my user input
handler function
writeFile


init function
